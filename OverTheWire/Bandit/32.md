What is $0 in a Bash Script?

The name of the terminal or shelled script is expanded using “$0”. At shell initialization, this is set. $0 is assigned to the name of that directory if Bash is called with a collection of commands. To put it simply, we utilize “$0” in bash to store the name of the script and display it in the terminal. The parameters for the bash command on Linux are “$0,” “$1,” and “$2, etc. The first one stores the name of the script, the second one stores the first value, and so on.
